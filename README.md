I am trying to implement the Canadian Multilingual Standard Keyboard on MacOS or something as close as possible to the Standard.
I am trying to follow the keyboard layout at the web address http://kbdlayout.info/KBDCAN/ as a guide, and the picture at
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/KB_Canadian_Multilingual_Standard_comment-fr.svg

Note: due to the lack of a right control key on many keyboards, I have put the group 2 key as a dead key, option + 2 (number row) .
If you do not want to use option+2, you can also access the same keys using control+option, and the shifted versions as control+shift.

# About the ME Extensions variant:
- Although not standard, I wanted to type certain transliteration characters including dot under, and line under diacritics, and so I added a separate group, it is accessible at option + 3 number row.
