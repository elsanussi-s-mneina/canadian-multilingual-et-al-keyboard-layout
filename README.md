# canadian-multilingual-et-al
I am trying to implement the Canadian Multilingual Standard Keyboard on MacOS or something as close as possible to the Standard.
I am trying to follow the keyboard layout at the web address http://kbdlayout.info/KBDCAN/ as a guide, and the picture at

Note: due to the lack of a right control key on many keyboards, I have put the group 2 key as a dead key, Alt-Gr + Ã© .
